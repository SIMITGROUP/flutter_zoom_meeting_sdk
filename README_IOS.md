# Setup iOS (WIP)

## 1. Download SDK

- Download the Zoom iOS SDK from the [Zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/)
- Create a `ZoomSDK/ios/` folder and extract the SDK contents into it.
- We only need `MobileRTC.xcframework` and `MobileRTCResources.bundle`

**Example Directory Structure:**

```bash
<YourApp>/
â”œâ”€â”€ ios/
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ ZoomSDK/
    â””â”€â”€ ios/
        â”œâ”€â”€ MobileRTC.xcframework
        â””â”€â”€ MobileRTCResources.bundle
```

## 2. Configure In Xcode

Navigate to `<YourApp>/ios` and open it with Xcode.

### 2.1 Runner Target Configuration

#### 2.1.1. Runner > General > Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content
    - Add: `MobileRTC.xcframework`

#### 2.1.2. Runner > Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries
    - Add: `MobileRTC.xcframework`

#### 2.1.3. Runner > Build Phases > Copy Bundle Resources
    - Add: `MobileRTCResources.bundle`

#### 2.1.4. Runner > Build Phases > Embed Frameworks
    - Add: `MobileRTC.xcframework`

### 2.2 Plugin Pod Configuration

Run the following command to generate the Podfile:

```bash
flutter build ios
```
> ðŸ’¡ You will see the expected error `Swift Compiler Error (Xcode): No such module 'MobileRTC'`
> Donâ€™t worry â€” we'll configure the Pod target next.

Now reopen the iOS project in Xcode and follow these steps:

#### 2.2.1. Pods > flutter_zoom_meeting_sdk > General > Frameworks and Libraries

    - Add: `MobileRTC.xcframework`
    - Set Embed to **Do Not Embed**

> âœ… This allows the plugin to correctly read and use the Zoom SDK.

## 3. Add Permissions to Info.plist

Edit `<YourApp>/ios/Runner/Info.plist` and add the following keys:

```bash
<key>NSBluetoothPeripheralUsageDescription</key>
<string>We will use your Bluetooth to access your Bluetooth headphones.</string>
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to see you during meetings, we need access to your camera.</string>
<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to hear you during meetings, we need access to your microphone.</string>
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>For people to share, we need access to your photos.</string>
```

---

Now run `flutter run`, you should be able to launch without errors.
